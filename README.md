# Alien Invasion
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears 
at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship 
right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the 
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky 
and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and 
destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet 
appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits 
the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player 
loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

## How to Play the game
Put all programs for "Alien Invasion" in a folder called "Alien Invasion"
In a terminal session install pygame:
```
python -m pip install --user pygame
```
if this command doesn't work you could try omitting the "--user" flag.

Once pygame has installed it should automatically create and build the game "Alien Ivasion".
You should now be able to play the game by running the"alien_invasion.py" program.
```
python alien_invasion.py
```
